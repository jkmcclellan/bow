# Bow

Bow is a Functional Programming companion library for Swift. It provides the following utilities:

{:.beginner}

- **Higher Kinded Types emulation**: Swift does not have native support for Higher Kinded Types, although the Generics Manifesto states it will in the future. However, we added support to begin with as itâ€™s needed in the rest of the library. The emulation is simple, but adds a small amount of boilerplate that we are working to automate.
- **Function manipulation utilities**: operators for composing, currying, reversing, complementing, and memoizing functions are available as part of the core module.
- **Data types**: the core module provides some useful data types like `Option`, `Either`, `Try` and `NonEmptyArray`, as well as wrappers over types in Foundation, like `ListK` and `SetK` that enable using them as Higher Kinded Types.
- **Type classes and instances**: definitions of usual type classes, like `Functor`, `Monad` and `Semigroup` are part of this module. Also, instances for primitive types and the provided data types are available.

- **Monad transformers**: work with nested effects in an easy and seamless way with types like `StateT` or `WriterT`.
- **Effects**: encapsulate side effects in the `IO` data type and manipulate it with the corresponding type classes.
- **Optics**: utilities to work with immutable data structures such as `Lenses` and `Prisms`.
- **Integrations**: Bow is compatible with `Result`, `RxSwift` and `BrightFutures`.

- **Recursion schemes**: manipulate recursive data structures with F-algebras and generic folding and unfolding functions.
- **Free monads**: describe your programs using the `Free` monad and create interpreters to concrete implementations.
